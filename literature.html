        bio: "Tim Winton is an acclaimed Australian novelist known for his lyrical portrayals of working-class lives and coastal communities. His fiction often explores small, ordinary moments that reveal deep moral and social tensions.",
        summary: "The story 'Neighbours' follows a young, newly married Australian couple who move into a culturally diverse inner-city suburb. Initially, they feel superior, irritated by the loud, emotional behaviour of their European and Macedonian neighbours, and disturbed by unfamiliar languages and customs. Over time, small acts of kindness, such as help with the garden and shared celebrations, slowly break down prejudice. The couple begin to appreciate the warmth, solidarity and communal spirit of their neighbours, especially during the wife's pregnancy and childbirth, when the whole neighbourhood emotionally supports them. The narrative shows how physical closeness can lead to emotional closeness and how stereotypes can dissolve through daily contact. Thematically, the story examines cultural diversity, empathy, belonging and the transformation of narrow individualism into a sense of shared humanity.",

At first she dislikes him for being quiet and unexciting, but his gentle presence and thoughtful character gradually draw her interest. Mrs. Baroda becomes disturbed by her own feelings, fearing they may threaten her identity as a 'respectable' wife. She decides to distance herself and leaves the plantation until the visit ends. Later, after time and reflection, she tells her husband that she wants Gouvernail to visit again and believes she has enough self-control. The story explores the tension between social respectability and private desire, the complexity of female psychology, and the subtle ways women manage their impulses under patriarchal expectations.",

        summary: "'A Devoted Son' tells the story of Rakesh, an obedient and academically brilliant son of a poor Indian oil-seller, Varma. Rakesh fulfils his father's dreams by becoming a successful doctor and dutifully caring for his parents. After Varma grows old and sick, Rakesh strictly controls his father's diet and medicine for his health. However, Varma experiences this care as oppression; he longs for tasty food and freedom rather than medical discipline. Their relationship deteriorates as Varma accuses Rakesh of cruelty, even though Rakesh genuinely wants to prolong his life. The story questions what true devotion means and shows the gap between a caregiver's intentions and an elder's emotional needs. Themes include filial duty, ageing, generational conflict, and the tension between medical science and human feelings.",

        summary: "'The Treasure in the Forest' follows two men, Evans and Hooker, who sail to a remote island after overhearing a Chinese man, Chang-hi, speak about hidden treasure. Driven by greed, they hurriedly interpret a rough map and hack their way through the dense forest. The journey is tense and suspicious, as they fear possible traps and betrayal. When they finally discover a pile of strange yellow lumps, they imagine great wealth and begin to handle them carelessly. Gradually, they realise too late that the treasure is coated with a deadly poison—Chang-hi's silent revenge against thieves. Both men suffer a painful, paralysing death. The story warns against uncontrolled greed, colonial exploitation, and the illusion that stolen wealth brings happiness, using suspense and irony to build a chilling moral lesson.",

        summary: "In 'My Old Home', the unnamed narrator returns to his childhood village after twenty years to sell his ancestral house. He feels nostalgic yet disappointed by the poverty and decay around him. He meets Runtu, his childhood playmate, who was once energetic and imaginative but is now worn down by hardship and social hierarchy. The invisible barrier of class and custom prevents them from relating as equals, although their memories remain tender. The narrator realises how feudal attitudes, such as strict respect distances, have crushed ordinary lives. Leaving the village, he feels both sorrow and a faint hope that the next generation, represented by Runtu's and his own nephews, might escape old constraints. The story explores memory, social change, class division and the painful gap between idealised childhood and harsh adult reality.",

        summary: "This reflective essay describes the writer's visit to Lumbini and other sacred Buddhist sites in the Tarai. As he observes the half-closed eyes of the Buddha statues and the setting sun, he reflects on the contrast between the serene spiritual message of peace and compassion and the surrounding poverty, pollution and political neglect. The essayist criticises superficial tourism and ritual that ignore the Buddha's deeper teaching of inner awakening and social responsibility. He also comments on environmental degradation, commercialization and the failure to protect heritage sites. Through poetic images, he urges readers to open their inner eyes, practice tolerance and work for a more just, harmonious society. The themes revolve around spirituality versus materialism, national identity, responsible development and the need to live the Buddha's message in daily life.",

Although villagers and a priest suspect he might be an angel, they treat him as a spectacle rather than a sacred being. The couple lock him in a chicken coop, charge admission to see him and become rich from the curious crowds. People project selfish wishes onto the old man but show little compassion for his suffering. The church delays recognition because the angel does not fit official expectations. Over time, the crowds lose interest, and the old man slowly recovers and flies away. The narrative uses magical realism to question blind faith, religious bureaucracy, human cruelty and the way society exploits the mysterious instead of seeking its deeper meaning.",

As the day ends, the imagery becomes quieter and more mysterious, with the 'hills' removing their 'bonnets' and the 'gentleman' leading children away, hinting at sunset and possibly death. The poem leaves meaning open, but many readers see it as an allegory of the soul's journey, where sunrise stands for birth or awakening and sunset for entry into another world.

        summary: "This essay examines marriage not just as a private relationship but as a key social institution shaped by history, religion and economics. Nehru traces how arranged marriages, dowry, caste rules and gender inequality have influenced marital practices in South Asia. He recognises that marriage can provide companionship, stability and responsible child-rearing, yet he also criticises customs that make it a prison, especially for women. The essay supports gradual reform: love, mutual respect and freedom of choice should replace blind tradition. Nehru argues that as society modernises, marriage must adapt to principles of equality and individual dignity. For NEB exams, the text is useful to discuss changing family patterns, women's rights and the tension between tradition and modernity.",

He warns that modern education and science often produce experts who know a lot about narrow fields but lack moral insight, leading to dangers like war, exploitation and environmental damage. True wisdom requires breadth of vision, imagination, sympathy and a sense of proportion, allowing people to see connections between things and to care about the welfare of others.
